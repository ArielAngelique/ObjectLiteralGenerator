# JSON OL Generator

This is a simple application to generate a JSON output from specified and custom inputs, written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It was developed as a going-away present for a friend and coworker whose computer loved to change up formatting on him, in a time when we regularly had to use this format and insert into a non-syntax highlighted field. 

There's not much to it. To add or remove pre-set fields, edit the table in the HTML file. The Generate JSON button dynamically adds to this table as well, and traverses the table row by row to generate the output.
